The Program Internal Form is an ordered ArrayList of Map.Entries,
containing the Token and the Token's Position in the Symbol Table.

There are 3 Token Classifications: Separator, Operator, Reserved Word.

For each token of the "separator" type, we build its general regex.
Each "separator" regex is an alternate in the general regex.
Due to the nature of our separators, there are some fringe cases:
	1. In case the separator is an escape sentence, we take it as it is into the regex.
	2. Otherwise, we create the regex by appending each character in its Hexadecimal ASCII representation.

For each token of the "operator" type, we build its general regex.
Each "operator" regex is an alternate in the general regex.
We create each regex by appending each character in its Hexadecimal ASCII representation.

For each token of the "reserved word" type, we build its general regex.
Each "reserved word" regex is an alternate in the general regex.
Due to the nature of our reserved words, we create each regex by appending each character in its Hexadecimal ASCII representation.
However, at the end of each regex, we ensure that it is ONLY followed by separators.
